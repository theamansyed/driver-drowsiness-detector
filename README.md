# ðŸ˜´ Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. This project uses facial landmark detection and Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to monitor a driverâ€™s alertness and trigger an alarm if signs of drowsiness are detected.

## ðŸš— Project Overview

Drowsiness while driving is a major cause of road accidents. This project helps detect signs of fatigue in drivers and provides an alert to prevent potential mishaps.

It works by:
- Monitoring the driverâ€™s eye movement through a webcam
- Calculating Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Triggering an alarm if the eyes remain closed for too long

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Scipy
- Imutils
- Pygame

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

The system uses Dlibâ€™s 68-point facial landmark detector to find the driverâ€™s eyes. It then calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):

```python
def eye_aspect_ratio(eye):
	A = distance.euclidean(eye[1], eye[5])
	B = distance.euclidean(eye[2], eye[4])
	C = distance.euclidean(eye[0], eye[3])
	return (A + B) / (2.0 * C)
